Whenever you make any changes and are about to upload the code, notify the group chat so we know when somebody is uploading and we don't override any existing changes
Also make sure to include comments to describe how and what you changed in the code
Try and adhere to the general coding style of the html
if there's a problem in merge.... screenshot it and we'll work something out....
